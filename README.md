# Python-Excel


Here we are using Pandas and Python to merge all xlsx ( Excel ) files in a folder and then merging them into a singel xlsx file.

This is useful if you are handeling alot of xlsx files from busniess systems etc.

I used this in production envitorments and I am very happy with the results!

Download the .py file and open it with your text editor or your favorite IDE. 

Set the path to the folder wich you have all the xlsx files. Then set where you would like the merge file.

then you simply run it with python. Remember you need to install pandas.

Thanks! :)
