# Python-Excel


Here we are using Pandas and Python with .xlsx ( Excel ) files. 

This is useful if you are handeling alot of xlsx files from busniess systems etc.

I used this in production envitorments and I am very happy with the results!

Download the .py file and open it with your text editor or your favorite IDE. 

Set the path to the folder wich you have all the xlsx files. 

The first .py file merges all .xlsx files in a folder and makes a new one. 

The second merges 2 excel sheets on a specific colum same as vlookup function in excel. So you match the two colums in Excel.

then you simply run it with python. Remember you need to install pandas.

Thanks! :)
